# Origins Forge for Minecraft

This is the GitHub repository for the Origins Forge mod, a forge port of the [Origins](https://github.com/apace100/origins-fabric) mods for fabric.

If you need help with **creating data packs** for the mod, visit [the official wiki](https://origins.readthedocs.io/). At some point in the future, this wiki will also contain information on how to create an add-on for the mod. 

If you are having trouble with a datapack, try it on fabric. If it works there, please report it as a bug here, attaching your logs if applicable and the datapack in question.

If you want to **report a bug**, please visit [the issue tracker](https://github.com/edwinmindcraft/origins-arrchitectury/issues). Make sure to check other existing issues first, and post detailed information about which mods and which version you are using, what you would expect to happen, and what happens instead. Also always include the log of your client and the server if possible.
