# Origins Forge: Experimental

This branch is an experimental branch that focuses on moving away from SerializableDataTypes and towards Codecs.
Using codecs would allow for writing, as well as reading json files, it would also increase the possibilities of
comparison to grant them the ability to basically work on any bit of code.

Another goal of this branch, will be to use something akin to dynamic registries to store powers, and then later on
actions and conditions, though this may be more complex.
